# Discord Moderation Bot

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Discord community management bot built with Python and discord.py. The bot has evolved from basic moderation capabilities to a full-featured community platform with advanced systems including XP/leveling, virtual economy, automated moderation, welcome images, support tickets, and interactive games. It features a modular cog-based architecture with PostgreSQL database integration for persistent data storage.

## System Architecture

The bot follows a modular architecture using Discord.py's Cog system:

- **Main Bot Class**: Central bot instance that loads configuration and manages cogs
- **Cog-Based Modules**: Separate modules for different functionality areas
- **Utility Modules**: Helper functions for permissions and data management
- **Configuration System**: JSON-based configuration for easy customization
- **File-Based Storage**: Simple JSON storage for warnings and persistent data

## Key Components

### Core Bot (`main.py`)
- **ModerationBot Class**: Main bot instance with configuration loading
- **Intent Management**: Proper Discord intents for message content, members, and moderation
- **Logging Setup**: File and console logging with date-based log files

### Moderation Cog (`cogs/moderation.py`)
- **Member Management**: Kick, ban, and timeout commands
- **Warning System**: Add, view, and manage user warnings
- **Permission Checks**: Role-based and permission-based access control
- **DM Notifications**: Optional direct messages to users on moderation actions

### Logging Cog (`cogs/logging.py`)
- **Event Tracking**: Automatic logging of member joins, leaves, and bans
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive event logging with embeds
- **Channel Integration**: Configurable log channel for server events

### Utility Cog (`cogs/utility.py`)
- **Server Information**: Detailed server stats and member counts
- **System Monitoring**: Bot performance and system information
- **General Commands**: Helpful utility commands for server management

### Permission System (`utils/permissions.py`)
- **Decorator-Based**: Clean permission checking with decorators
- **Multi-Layer Security**: Both Discord permissions and role-based checks
- **Configurable Roles**: Admin and moderator roles defined in configuration

### Data Management (`utils/database.py`)
- **File-Based Storage**: JSON files for persistent data
- **Warning Manager**: Complete warning system with CRUD operations
- **Data Safety**: Error handling and automatic directory creation

## Data Flow

1. **Command Processing**: Discord events → Bot command handler → Cog methods
2. **Permission Validation**: Command invocation → Permission decorators → Role/permission checks
3. **Action Execution**: Validated commands → Discord API calls → Result feedback
4. **Logging**: Actions → Event listeners → Log channel/file output
5. **Data Persistence**: Warnings/data → JSON file storage → Retrieval on demand

## External Dependencies

- **discord.py**: Core Discord API library for bot functionality
- **asyncio**: Asynchronous programming support
- **psutil**: System monitoring capabilities
- **platform**: System information gathering

## Deployment Strategy

The bot is designed for simple deployment:

- **Environment Variables**: Discord bot token (not included in repository)
- **File Structure**: Minimal setup with automatic directory creation
- **Configuration**: Single JSON file for all bot settings
- **Logging**: Automatic log file creation in logs/ directory
- **Data Storage**: Automatic data/ directory for persistent storage

Key deployment considerations:
- Requires Discord bot token as environment variable
- Needs appropriate Discord bot permissions (kick, ban, manage messages, etc.)
- File system write access for logs and data storage
- Python 3.8+ with discord.py library

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
CI/CD Interest: User expressed interest in GitHub Actions and automated deployments.
